Half received up to four infusions of the bisphosphonate zoledronate acid (brand name Reclast), administered in 18 month intervals. The other half received placebo infusions. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that the women who received zoledronate had a lower risk of developing a fracture than those on the placebo.

The story addressed the significance of the findings, the size of the benefit, the quality of the evidence, and conflicts of interest. It also mentioned potential major adverse effects that the study could not rule out. We think the coverage could have been improved by mentioning side effects and alternative strategies for bone health. Bone breaks and fractures become more common as people age. At age 65, most women receive their first DEXA scan, a test that uses low-dose X-rays to measure the amount of calcium and other minerals inside the bone. The test results score bone as normal thinning (osteopenia) or very thin (osteoporosis). It is widely recommended that women with osteoporosis make a type of bone-building drug called a bisphosphonate. This study looked at the effects of one bisphosphonate — Reclast — in women with osteopenia, which is believed to be a much larger population. New stories about studies that might encourage wider use of any medication should include ample information about potential benefits and harms. In this case, bisphosphonates have a fraught history that should inform news coverage. As this NPR article from 2009 explains, the diagnosis of osteopenia was created in 1992 to describe women with thinning bones based on a scan. That opened up a new group of potential patients for bisphosphonates, despite little research to show the drugs could prevent fractures and uncertainty about long-term safety.
